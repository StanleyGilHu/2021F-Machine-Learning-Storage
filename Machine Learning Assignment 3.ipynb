    "Question 1:Explain in detail about how logistic regression has been derived from Bernoulli distribution and when to apply logistic regression instead of linear regression ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Logistical regression is derived from Bernoulli distribution in that Bernoulli distribution can be represented by q=1-p, where q and p are the two possible results of a test, adding up to a total probability of 1. Logistical regression follows this formula to some degree, with two endpoints 1 and 0, sorting information between the two extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linear regression intakes data and produces a linear equation, with no limits on the x or y vallues. Linear regression is more suited to situations where predicting an approximate y value with real life measurement units for a corresponding x might be necessary, while logistical regression is more focused on sorting and labelling into groups or areas, with no possible extensions beyond the 0 or 1 value.\n",

    "    Precision is the measurement of how many more accurate results are recieved from a prediction, while recall is the measurement of how many of the total accurate results are recieved. For example, an algorithm that only selects 1/10 correct results, but selects that one correctly, might have high precision but low accuracy, while an algorithm that get 10/10 correct results but also gets 11 incorrect results at the same time would have high recall and low precision. The goal is to optimize an algorithm that gets both. "

[30 Pts] The ICU data set (icu.csv from icollege) consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult intensive care unit (ICU).
